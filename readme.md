# ![GPTGodIcon](./gemini64x64.png) Gemini AI God Bukkit Plugin
Modified version of the [ChatGPT bukkit plugin by "BigYous"](https://github.com/YOUSY0US3F/minecraft-gpt-god-plugin) which uses the google gemini (within free-tier limits) to provide an improved AI roleplay experience free of charge. Join a world ruled by the AI and hope that your new overlord is having a good day. You will be sent on missions from God, have your buildings and photos judged, be rewarded greatly, or explode spectacularly. Tread carefully....... it see's and hears everything....

For a concise overview of game modes, code structure, and build/deploy steps, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

What's Changed:

- [x] Ported to google gemini from chatgpt
    - scrapped all openai support at the moment in favour of full gemini consistency for now
    - [x] context window is now one million for `gemini-1.5-flash` and 2 million for `gemini-1.5-pro`
    - [x] Voice transcription requests are now bundled (to avoid api spam) and using the gemini 1.5 flash model
    
- [x] Ported voice synthesis to Speechify (super godly narrator voice for free! IT EVEN BREATHES!)
- [x] Improved context handling (cured the AI god of dementia)
- [x] separated model usage into "primary" and "secondary" model so that a cheaper model may be used for medial tasks
- [x] decreased call count to primary model and unified commands and communication behaviour to one context 
- [x] Added real multi-turn mode (including model responses in context)
- [x] Improved system instruction prompt design for better roleplay output
- [x] Gave the AI a better sense of time using minecraft time of day timestamps
- [x] various bug fixes and codebase improvements
- [x] added new decree function for the ai to drop floating commandments in the world if it is displeased
- [x] added model temperature configuration control to improve model creativity
- [x] Rolling context expiry for new multi-turn when token limit is approaching
- [x] Give the AI eyes using the papermc ImageryAPI and gemini vision api (so the AI can decide if your monuments to its honor are ugly or not)
  - [x] Added player camera item (get with `/givecamera`) for fun photography for god missions
  - [x] Functioning structure rendering with automatic camera positioning
- [x] Created sequential but non-blocking thread queue for the api wrapper class (AsyncTaskQueue in GptAPI)
- [x] allow custom voices on speechify api (fetch available voices and check for customs by display name)

Todo:

- [ ] Maybe add option to choose between gemini and open ai?
- [ ] Fix bug with events coming in after round restart (cut off async threadpool of logger on reset or associate events with some kind of session id)
- [ ] selfie mode for god camera
- [ ] spawn sound and particle effects on camera shutter
- [ ] Add ability to save favourite structures and scatter them across the new map on round start
- [ ] Add option to renderer to ignore all blocks not in a structure (so that trees don't block the view and make the ai think you built a bush)
- [ ] Give god a tool to give a user the camera they would otherwise get from `/givecamera`
- [ ] tell gemini to output speech in SSML format for speechify

## Local Setup

- clone the repo
- run `./gradlew` in the root of the repo
- download [paper mc server version 1.21.1](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper)
- setup the server
- download [voicechat bukkit plugin 2.5.24](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat/version/bukkit-2.5.24)
- download [imagery api 1.2.1](https://github.com/jensjeflensje/minecraft_imagery/releases/tag/1.2.1)
- download [ImageFrame 1.7.10](https://hangar.papermc.io/LOOHP/ImageFrame/versions) for printing out photos on maps
- place the jar files in the plugins folder of your server
- [install fabric for 1.21.1](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
- [download the fabric api jar for extra mod compatibility](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/5848063)
- download [the voice chat mod version 1.21.1-2.5.24 for fabric](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat/version/fabric-1.21.4-2.5.24)
- place those in your mods folder in .minecraft
- (Optional) [install iris + sodium](https://www.irisshaders.dev/) and [BSL Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/shaders/bsl-shaders) for a more godly experience

## Config
- Get a free gemini api key from [aistudio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- Get a free speechify api key from [console.sws.speechify.com/tts](https://console.sws.speechify.com/tts)
- configure primary model to be `model-name: gemini-1.5-pro` for smarter role-play output at slower speeds. Both models are fun, so give them both a try
- configure primary model to be `model-name: gemini-1.5-flash` if you want fast model times such as `rate: 30` or below.
    - **NOTE:** Do not go below 30-32 on the free tier pro model or you will hit your 2 requests per minute and 50 requests per day fast
    - **NOTE:** if you set your primary model to `gemini-1.5-flash` then set secondary to `gemini-1.5-flash-8b` as free-tier rate limits are per-model name
    - **do not** use the `1.0` models or other models which are not [multimodal](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/multimodal-ai) for secondary model. This program relies on the audio and visual processing of the latest Gemini 1.5 models.
    - the flash model can go below 20 and performs quite nicely with the rapid feedback
    - for a fast-feedback experience try setting both models to `gemini-1.5-flash` and try a rate of about `rate: 20` to `rate: 30`
    - do NOT use `gemini-1.5-pro` as the secondary model
- custom voices: if you create a custom voice on speechify, you can find it's real id (not display name) using the `/aitest voice list p` command to use as the voice id

New config keys:
- `speechify-model`: one of `simba-english`, `simba-base`, `simba-multilingual` (default), `simba-turbo`.
- `prompts`: optional overrides for AI prompts. Leave values empty to use defaults.
  - `prompts.gamemode.SANDBOX` and `prompts.gamemode.DEATHMATCH`
  - `prompts.base.PROMPT_BASE`, `REQUIREMENTS`, `GUIDANCE`, `STYLE`, `ESCALATION`, `ROLEPLAY`
  - `prompts.commands.CONTEXT`, `prompts.vision.CONTEXT`, `prompts.summarize.CONTEXT`,
    `prompts.transcription.MANY_CONTEXT`, `prompts.transcription.SINGLE_CONTEXT`

## Building

- Prerequisite: JDK 21 (server and build both use Java 21)
- Build with the Gradle wrapper:
  - Windows (PowerShell): `./gradlew clean shadowJar`
  - Linux/macOS: `./gradlew clean shadowJar`
- Output: `build/libs/gptgodmc-<version>-all.jar` (fat/shaded jar)
  - Use the `-all.jar` in your server's `plugins` folder.
  - Remove any thin jar (without `-all`) to avoid missing dependency errors.

## Development

Development requires JDK 21. The repo includes the Gradle wrapper (currently 8.7), so you don't need a system Gradle install.

Workspace has been setup for VSCode as well.

plugin jar releases show up under `<project_dir>\build\libs`

## Windows
Use PowerShell from the project root:
```powershell
./gradlew shadowJar
```
The plugin will be at `build\libs\gptgodmc-<version>-all.jar`.

## *Nix

JDK 21 required. Use the wrapper, no system Gradle needed:

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

## Troubleshooting

- NoClassDefFoundError: `com.knuddels.jtokkit.Encodings`
  - Ensure you're deploying the shaded `-all.jar`. The build shades `jtokkit` and other runtime deps.

## Running

- run the server once then go to `plugins/gptgodmc/config.yml`
- paste in your ~~OpenAi API or~~ Gemini key
- run the server again
- launch minecraft with fabric (make sure voice chat mod is installed)
- **NOTE:** on MacOS you need to use a [launcher such as prisim](https://prismlauncher.org/) to allow microphone access permission to for the plugin
  - [more info here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/macos)
- finally, connect to the server at `localhost`
